# DriveTrainforSweeper
Here is my concept for the drivetrain for Sweeper.
DO NOT DOWNLOAD. I cannot stress how much this matters. Please just copy the code, and paste it in a .java file you have created. You need to create a new file titled Sweeper.java
for this to work. Again, DO NOT DOWNLOAD. just COPY AND PASTE the code into a SWEEPER.JAVA file.
